### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd kibo-x
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Development Mode

The application currently runs with dummy data for development and testing. All data is stored in local state and will reset when you refresh the page.

## Supabase Integration

### Setup Instructions

1. **Create a Supabase project**
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Create a new project
   - Note your project URL and anon key

2. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   ```

3. **Run the migration**
   Execute the SQL migration file in your Supabase dashboard:
   ```bash
   supabase/migrations/001_initial_candidate_tracking_schema.sql
   ```

4. **Install Supabase client**
   ```bash
   npm install @supabase/supabase-js
   ```

5. **Update components to use Supabase**
   Replace the dummy data imports with Supabase service calls from `lib/supabase.js`

### Database Schema

The system uses two main tables:

- **`requisitions`**: Job requisition information with customizable hiring stages
- **`candidates`**: Candidate profiles linked to requisitions with stage tracking

Both tables include:
- Automatic timestamp management
- Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection
- Optimized indexes for performance
- JSONB fields for flexible data storage
